# RC Plane Project
## A Beginner's Guide to Entering the Field of RC Aviation

Welcome to my personal journey into the world of RC (Radio-Controlled) aircraft. This detailed repository documents my very first attempt at constructing an RC airplane entirely from scratch - no prefabricated kits, no commercial airframes, and no prior experience. 
What commenced as a simple curiosity quickly evolved into a full-fledged engineering and design challenge that taught me fundamentals in aerodynamics, electronics, materials, and mechanical design. 

This project isn't just a simple build log - it's a beginner-friendly, step-by-step resource for anyone who wants to get into RC planes on a realistic budget, using widely available materials, and with a focus on reusability and scalability. Every decision I made during this process was carefully balanced between performance, cost, and long-term value. For example, while this plane utilizes affordable components, the transmitter and reciever setup are overly expensive, yet they allow me to reuse the same controller across multiple aircraft in the future - enabling easy growth within the hobby without repeatedly reinvesting in new gear. 

This guide was created by a newcomer, and with complete newcomers in mind. If you've ever thought about building your own RC airplane but felt overwhelmed by the complexity or cost, this project is for you. I cover everything from:

1. Material selection (why I chose foamboard over cardboard or balsa wood)

2. Airframe design (including blueprint planning, airfoil testing, CG calculations, and structural reinforcements)

3. Power system setup (motor, ESC, battery, propellor matching)

4. Control surface layout and servo placement

5. Mounting and wiring tips

6. Test flights, crash recovery and iteration

Throughout the build, I prioritized DIY accessibility. My goal was not just to build something that flies, but to understand why it flies and how each subsystem works. I hand-cut every piece, tuned it through real test throws, and adapted the design to match the materials I had on hand. The result is a high-wing, beginner-friendly trainer that is straightforward, efficient, and durable enough to withstand the learning process - including crashes and hand-launched test flights. 

This project is meant to spark inspiration and lower the barrier to entry into a rewarding, challenging, and, realistically, a costly hobby. It's not just about flying - it's about building, innovating, iterating, creating, and designing something that flies. 

Whether you're a student, hobbyist, or simply someone who enjoys making things, I hope this guide helps you take your first steps into RC aviation. If you're looking to build your own plane from scratch, feel free to explore the folders and documentation here - and don't hesitate to use, modify, or improve upon what I've done. 

Enjoy the process!



# STEP 1: Parts Selection, Electronics, Everything Necessary to Make a Plane Fly

Before designing and assembling the airframe, I began by selecting the key electronic components required to make an RC airplane functional and controllable. Since this was my first RC build, I chose to source the main electronics from Flite Test - a well-known and beginner-friendly site that offers high-quality, affordable parts designed for DIY foamboard aircraft. 
Here is a detailed breakdown of the components, accessories, and parts I selected, and what each one does:

# Battery - LiPo (Lithium Polymer) or LiFePO₄ (Lithium Iron Phosphate)
PURPOSE: Powers the entire plane - the motor, reciever, and servos. 
SPECS: Usually a 2S (6.6-7.4V) or a 3S (11.1V) battery with 1000-1500 mAh capacity. 
MY CHOICE: Tattu 1300mAh 45C 3S1P 11.1V Lipo Battery Pack With XT-60 Plug
THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND: When selecting a battery, it is critical to note that LiPo batteries are more prone to explosions if not kept properly. However, these batteries generally last longer and offer better performance than LiFePO₄ batteries. In the end, it really is a matter of your preference - performance or safety.
